# esqueleto-fts
Haskell bindings for postgres full text search in esqueleto.
for a good explenation see https://rachbelaid.com/postgres-full-text-search-is-good-enough/

you can turn postgres into a database that is similar
in performance for search as elastic search, without having 
to deal with elastic search.
